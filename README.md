# python-bzz
A Python library for decompressing and compressing BZZ files that were originally created for a couple of old PS1 games.

## Notice
This project is still work-in-progress

## Features

It supports the following features:
 - Extract/Decompress BZZ files
   - Note: It does not name or properly type the files. I'm working on a file type map 

I hope to add the following:
 - Identify and correctly type output files
 - Compress files into BZZ format

## Why did I start this?
To support mods for the PS1 game, The Grinch; especially Archipelago randomizer support. For more information on Archipelago, please go [here](https://archipelago.gg/)
